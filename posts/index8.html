    <p><a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers">PostgreSQL foreign data wrappers</a> are used to connect PostgreSQL database to different datasources, e.g. other <span class="caps">SQL</span> databases, <span class="caps">CSV</span> files, <span class="caps">XLS</span>&nbsp;spreadsheets&times;</p>
<p>The one I&#8217;ve been interested in for several months is <a href="https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-ogr-fdw">Paul Ramsey&#8217;s <span class="caps">OGR</span> <span class="caps">FDW</span></a> - it gives you access to <span class="caps">OGR</span> supported spatial formats directly from your database. <em>No more shapefiles lying&nbsp;around?</em></p>
<p>Each foreign data wrapper should have three basic&nbsp;components:</p>
<ul>
<li>foreign server&nbsp;object</li>
<li>foreign user mapping - not necessary if you&#8217;re not connecting to other&nbsp;database</li>
<li>foreign&nbsp;table(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>I got some data about <a href="http://www.dibavod.cz/download.php?id_souboru=1413">rivers</a> and <a href="http://www.dibavod.cz/download.php?id_souboru=1416">dams</a> from <a href="http://www.dibavod.cz"><span class="caps">DIBAVOD</span></a> open datasets to play&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>First define the foreign server&nbsp;object:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>CREATE SERVER dibavod
FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER ogr_fdw
OPTIONS (
    datasource &#39;/downloads/dibavod&#39;,
    format &#39;ESRI Shapefile&#39;,
    config_options &#39;SHAPE_ENCODING=CP1250&#39;
);
</pre></div>


<p>Note the <span class="caps">OGR</span> specific driver configuration options are available inside <code>config_options</code>. In case of <span class="caps">ESRI</span> Shapefiles, the <code>datasource</code> is the directory your files reside&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s create PostgreSQL tables (use <code>ogrinfo</code> or Paul&#8217;s <code>ogr_fdw_info</code> to list the&nbsp;columns):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>CREATE FOREIGN TABLE rivers (
    fid integer,
    utokj_id numeric,
    utokjn_id numeric,
    utokjn_f numeric,
    prprop_z integer,
    ex_jh integer,
    pozn text,
    shape_leng numeric,
    naz_tok text,
    idvt integer,
    tok_id numeric,
    shape_len numeric,
    geom geometry(LINESTRING, 5514)
)
SERVER dibavod
OPTIONS (layer &#39;A02_Vodni_tok_JU&#39;);

CREATE FOREIGN TABLE dams (
    fid integer,
    objectid integer,
    naz_na text,
    nadr_gid numeric,
    kota_hladi numeric,
    hloubka numeric,
    zatop_ploc numeric,
    objem numeric,
    kota_hraz numeric,
    kota_preli numeric,
    kota_vypus numeric,
    plocha_m2 numeric,
    shape_area numeric,
    shape_len numeric,
    geom geometry(MULTIPOLYGON, 5514)
)
SERVER dibavod
OPTIONS (LAYER &#39;A05_Vodni_nadrze&#39;);
</pre></div>


<p>Note the <code>fid</code> column - required for <strong>write access</strong> to underlying&nbsp;datasource.</p>
<p>Things to&nbsp;remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>foreign tables mean no constraints nor&nbsp;indices</li>
<li>no indices mean spatial queries are terribly slow compared to&nbsp;PostGIS</li>
<li>I like the idea of <code>CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE dams2 AS SELECT * FROM dams</code>, not sure what to use it for&nbsp;though</li>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been sort of living in Brno for the last 7 years (college included). It&#8217;s quite a hilly city, with lots of cars, very good public transportation system and ever-improving cycling infrastructure. All these years I was using trams, buses and trolleybuses to get myself from one place to&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>These are all great,&nbsp;because:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can read while you&nbsp;ride</li>
<li>you are generally faster than car during rush&nbsp;hour</li>
<li>you don&#8217;t waste your time trying to park your&nbsp;car</li>
</ul>
<p>These all suck,&nbsp;because:</p>
<ul>
<li>public transportation is quite expensive in&nbsp;Brno</li>
<li>people stink in&nbsp;summer</li>
<li>some people stink in winter as&nbsp;well</li>
<li>you usually have to change several lines to actually get where you&nbsp;want</li>
<li>they&#8217;re&nbsp;crowded</li>
</ul>
<p>My period card expired on March 8 and I decided not to renew it. Why? See the list above. As I don&#8217;t have a car and I work at the far end of the city, I can either ride a bike or run to work. Ask me how it&#8217;s been for the first month? Not bad at&nbsp;all.</p>
<div class="text-center"><a href="{filename}/assets/a-month-of-commuting-on-my-own/training_calendar.png"><img data-echo="/posts/assets/a-month-of-commuting-on-my-own/training_calendar_small.png" title="Strava training log" class="img-rounded"></a><p><strong>Figure:</strong> March Strava&nbsp;log.</p></div>

<h2>What&#8217;s so great about&nbsp;commuting?</h2>
<p>Not so long ago <em>I considered commuting a waste of time</em>. It took me 40-50 minutes to get to work and about the same to get back home. That&#8217;s 1-2 hours not being productive, not doing anything at all actually, just changing&nbsp;places.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a <em>terrible mistake</em> to do. It&#8217;s much better to see this time as an <strong>opportunity</strong> to do that little extra for yourself - walk, run, ride. Even though it takes me a bit longer than public transport (showering and dressing included), it leaves me with totally different state of mind in the end - it just starts me up (hello Rolling&nbsp;Stones).</p>
<p>You can go for a ride right from work. That&#8217;s&nbsp;priceless.</p>
<p>As a by-product I started to care more about what I eat and when I eat it. I actually spend time cooking so I get enough food during the day. Something I didn&#8217;t do before, because you can always buy something sweet before the bus comes,&nbsp;right?</p>
<div class="text-center"><a href="https://www.zimmi.cz/posts/assets/a-month-of-commuting-on-my-own/map.pdf"><embed style="width:100%; height:250px" src="https://www.zimmi.cz/posts/assets/a-month-of-commuting-on-my-own/map.pdf" title="Daily commute in Brno" class="img-rounded" type="application/pdf"></a><p><strong>Figure:</strong> Daily commute in Brno: bike in pink, run in green. <a href="https://www.zimmi.cz/posts/assets/a-month-of-commuting-on-my-own/map.pdf">See the full&nbsp;version.</a></p></div>

<h2>What&#8217;s not so great about&nbsp;commuting?</h2>
<p><strong>Weather</strong>, especially in spring and autumn, often sucks. Sometimes I come to work soaking wet, nothing a hot shower wouldn&#8217;t fix though. Someone still needs to clean the&nbsp;bike&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Traffic</strong> sucks in the evening. I get up before six, leave home before half past six, thus avoid heavy traffic. Riding a bike home in the evening is threatening sometimes and a bit of mutual respect between pedestrians, cyclists and drivers would&nbsp;do.</p>
<p><strong>Cycling paths</strong> sometimes end right before the big crossroads. Often drivers use parts of the network as parking lanes, which puts you in danger&nbsp;suddenly.</p>
<p><strong>Other cyclists, skaters, people walking their dogs, little kids</strong> usually don&#8217;t care about you at all. You better don&#8217;t get distracted if you want to get home safe and&nbsp;sound.</p>
<p><strong>Books are hard to read</strong> on the&nbsp;bike.</p>
<h2>Does it tell you something about your&nbsp;city?</h2>
<p>I guess the city you see on foot or from atop a saddle is completely different than the one seen from a bus or a&nbsp;car.</p>
<p>Is it rather car or bike friendly? Do you feel at risk riding a bike or running? Is it faster to run/ride or drive? Does your city actually want you to leave your car at home at all, or has it been designed for&nbsp;cars?</p>
<p>River seems to be blessing when your city has one (unless flood strikes, different story). <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/T6wMLSCFzZU2">If done right</a>, its shores might become one of the most beautiful parts of the city. Something Brno needs to catch up with other&nbsp;cities.</p>
<p>I hope one day I&#8217;ll get up and see Brno changing in front of me. <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3058685/paris-is-redesigning-its-major-intersections-for-pedestrians-not-cars">Just like Paris is right now.</a> We all die in the end, so why not to take a walk before we&nbsp;do?</p>

    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I&#8217;m an enthuastic developer, but I do not code for a living. I&#8217;m just the ordinary guy who keeps editing a wrong file wondering why <em>the heck</em> the changes are not being&nbsp;applied.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">TL</span>;<span class="caps">DR</span>:</strong> I do think <code>npm</code> might be the&nbsp;answer.</p>
<h2>Wonderful world of JavaScript&nbsp;DevOps</h2>
<p>When I first started using JavaScript on the server side with <code>node.js</code>, I felt overwhelmed by numerous options to automate tasks. There was <code>npm</code> taking care of backend dependencies. Then I would build a&nbsp;frontend and found out about <code>bower</code> for handling frontend dependencies. Then it would be great to have some kind of minification/obfuscation/uglification/you-name-it task. And the <code>build</code> task. And the <code>build:prod</code> task. And how about <code>eslint</code> task? And then I would end up spending hours doing nothing, just reading blogs about the tools being used by others who do code for a&nbsp;living.</p>
<p><strong>Intermezzo:</strong> I think my coding is slow. Definitely slower than yours. I&#8217;m getting better&nbsp;though.</p>
<h2>Using the&nbsp;force</h2>
<p>Looking back I find it a bit stressful - how <em>the heck</em> do I choose the right tools? Where&#8217;s Yoda to help me out? Anyway, next to adopt after <code>npm</code> was <code>bower</code>. And I liked it, even though some packages were missing - but who cares as long as there is no better way, right? Except there is&hellip; I&nbsp;guess.</p>
<p>Automation was next in the line to tackle. So I chose <code>gulp</code> without a bit of hesitation. It was a&nbsp;hype, a bigger than <code>grunt</code> back then. I even heard of <code>yeoman</code>, but until now I still don&#8217;t know what it actually does. And I&#8217;m happy with&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>A short summary so&nbsp;far:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>npm</code> for backend&nbsp;dependencies</li>
<li><code>bower</code> for frontend&nbsp;dependencies</li>
<li><code>gulp</code> for running&nbsp;tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>So far, so&nbsp;good.</p>
<h2>Is Bower going to&nbsp;die?</h2>
<p>Then I stumbled upon this tweet and started panicking. Or rather started to feel cheated. <em>It took me time to set all this up and now it&#8217;s useless? Or&nbsp;what?</em></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bower development is stopped. Move to npm, if you haven&#39;t already. <a href="https://t.co/RQRcE7DT5V">https://t.co/RQRcE7DT5V</a></p>&mdash; Nacho Coloma (@nachocoloma) <a href="https://twitter.com/nachocoloma/status/663622545162280960">November 9, 2015</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Seeing it now, I&#8217;m glad I read this. And I really don&#8217;t know what happened to Bower, if anything at&nbsp;all.</p>
<h2>Keeping it&nbsp;simple</h2>
<p>So Bower&#8217;s dying, what are you going to do about that? You&#8217;ll use <code>npm</code> instead! And you&#8217;ll have a&nbsp;single source of truth called <code>package.json</code>. You&#8217;l resolve all the dependencies with a single <code>npm install</code> command and feel like a king. We&#8217;re down to two now - <code>npm</code> and <code>gulp</code>.</p>
<h2>Gulp, Gulp&nbsp;everywhere!</h2>
<p>When you get rid of Bower, next feeling you have is your <code>gulpfile.js</code> just got off the leash. It got really big and grew to ~160 lines of code and became a nightmare to&nbsp;manage.</p>
<p>So you split it into <a href="https://github.com/zimmicz/bookmap/commit/98a3ce451856e2beaac8fa2be9eb3b7e2878b0a7">task files</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/zimmicz/bookmap/commit/07eaf7d355a47ff9d08e5b7138791a67669534d6">config file</a>. What a relief. But you still realize a <strong>half</strong> of your <code>package.json</code> dependencies starts with <code>gulp-</code>. And you hate&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2>Webpack for the&nbsp;win</h2>
<p>For me, a non-developer, setting the <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a> wasn&#8217;t easy. I didn&#8217;t find docs very helpful either. Reading the website for the first time, I didn&#8217;t even understand what it should be used for. I&nbsp;got it working eventually. And I got rid of <code>gulp</code>, <code>gulp-connect</code>, <code>gulp-less</code>, <code>gulp-nodemon</code>, <code>gulp-rename</code>, <code>gulp-replace</code>, <code>gulp-task-listing</code> and <code>gutil</code>. And the whole <code>gulpfile.js</code>. That was a big win for&nbsp;me.</p>
<h2>But how do you run&nbsp;tasks?</h2>
<p>Well&hellip;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>npm run start-dev <span class="c1"># which in turn calls the code below</span>
npm run start-webpack <span class="p">&amp;</span> <span class="nv">NODE_ENV</span><span class="o">=</span>development nodemon server.js <span class="c1"># where start-webpack does the following</span>
node_modules/webpack-dev-server/bin/webpack-dev-server.js --quiet --inline --hot --watch
</pre></div>


<p>That&#8217;s it. If I need to build code, I run <code>npm run build</code>, which calls some other tasks from <code>scripts</code> section in the <code>package.json</code>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty much it. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a silver bullet, but I feel like I finally found peace of mind for my future JavaScript development. At least for a month or so before some other guy comes to&nbsp;town.</p>

    <p>We have to deal with <span class="caps">DGN</span> drawings quite often at <a href="http://www.clevermaps.cz">CleverMaps</a> - heavily used for infrastructure projects (highways, roads, pipelines), they are a pure nightmare to the <span class="caps">GIS</span> person inside me. Right now, I&#8217;m only capable of converting it into a raster file and serve it with Geoserver.

<span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">generate_series</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">10000000</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Let&#8217;s retrieve next row for each row in that&nbsp;table:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="n">a</span>
<span class="k">LEFT</span> <span class="k">JOIN</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="k">ON</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">-- note the LEFT JOIN is needed to get the last row as well</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Not&nbsp;bad.</p>
<h2>Using window&nbsp;function</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/functions-window.html">Window functions</a> are real fun. They&#8217;re great if you&#8217;re doing counts, sums or ranks by groups. And, to my surprise, they&#8217;re great in finding next rows as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>With the same <code>test</code> table, we retrieve next row for each row with the following&nbsp;query:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">lead</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">OVER</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">test</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">test</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>How does that score without an index? Better than the <code>JOIN</code> clause.</p>
